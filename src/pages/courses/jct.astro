          <Intro>
            The JCT contracts are based on the Construction Act, a piece of
            legislation specifically drafted to protect contractors and avoid
            disputes.
          </Intro>
          <p>
            During the course, we explain how the contracts work and how you can
            use them to your advantage. By following a few simple steps, you can
            ensure that all the work you do is properly quoted and paid for. We
            will review these steps and ensure you can take on new projects
            without stress.

          >
          <Intro>
            During our time as Contract Administrators, we have come across many
            myths that either contradict the contract clauses or have nothing to
            do with the contract itself.
          </Intro>
          <p>
            We will debunk all common construction myths and conduct real-life
            scenario workshops at the end of the course to test your knowledge
            in practice.
