          Did you realise your indoor space has a big impact on your well-being?
        </h3>
        <p class="ss-text-intro">
          Poor indoor air quality, the presence of VOCs, and excessive noise
          pollution can all compromise physical health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inadequate natural light and a disconnection from nature can adversely
          affect our mood and mental well-being. Each of these factors can
          contribute to 'sick building syndrome', reinforcing the significance
          of a health-oriented space for our overall wellness.
